This is a Simple Calculator, that i created using one of the most famous javscript library i.e React.js. I use React HOOKS for the state management. This is my first time of using
React hooks to manage state ina functional components.

This is my first project, entirely written in HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It used one of the most popular library of JavaScript i.e. React.
This is a simple calculator, that do simple functioning i.e. 
  1. Addition
  2. Subtraction
  3. Multiplication
  4. Division

I know there are lot of other functionalities are available in calculator. So, Currently I am working on many other features of a calculator and will keep on updating the repository as soon as it is done

The color palette that is used for this design is based on very simplistic design i.e. 3 colors
